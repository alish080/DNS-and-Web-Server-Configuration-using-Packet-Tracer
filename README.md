## 💻 Lab Overview

In this lab, you will learn:

- How to configure a **DNS server** to resolve domain names to IP addresses
- How to set up a **Web Server** and host a simple website
- How to access the website from a **PC using both IP and domain name**

---

## 📝 Step-by-Step Summary

1. Configure the **Web Server** and host `index.html`.
2. Configure the **DNS Server** with an **A record** pointing the domain to the Web Server IP.
3. Configure the **PC** with the DNS Server IP in network settings.
4. Test connectivity:
   - Access the website using **Web Server IP**
   - Access the website using **Domain Name**
5. Edit `index.html` on Web Server to see live updates on the PC.

## ⚡ Key Concepts

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Converts human-friendly domain names into IP addresses for computers.
- **Web Server**: Hosts websites and serves `index.html` to clients.
- **Client-Server Model**: PC requests the website, Web Server responds.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Make sure the **DNS Server IP is correctly configured on the PC**.
- Use **exact domain names** as configured in DNS.
- Edit the `index.html` file on the **Web Server only**, not the PC or DNS Server.
